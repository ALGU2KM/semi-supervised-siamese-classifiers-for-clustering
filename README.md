# Semi-supervised siamese classifiers for clustering

It implements semi-supervised siamese classifiers for clustering (S3C2) published in Neural Networks: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608020301374. This demo contains an implementation of S3C2 with use of fully connected network (main.py) and convolutional architecture (semi-conv.py). Pairwise constraints for MNIST are located in "dane.zip" file. Contact me if you need pairwise constraints for other datasets (Fashion-MNIST, Letters, Reuters).
